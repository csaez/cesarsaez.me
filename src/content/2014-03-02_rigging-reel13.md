Hi guys,

I just updated my reel (unfortunatelly had to cut a lot of stuff) and
I'm now actively looking for a job opportunity as Character TD/Technical
Artist (preferably full-time, I'm ok with relocation). I'd really appreciate
if you could pass this around.

Here's also a [link to my resume](http://cesarsaez.me/pages/resume.html), just in case ;-)

Thank you!
