Title: RigIcon goes open source
Author: Cesar Saez
Tags: code, tools

Hi folks,

Do you remember [rigicon][1]? well, now you can get it from [github][2]!

![RigIcon]({filename}images/rigicon.png "RigIcon")

There's also a brief [documentation][3] and a [pre-packed xsiaddon][4] in
case you don't want to mess with the source code, dependencies and so
on... if you have no idea what I'm talking about take a look at the [old
preview][5].

You will need [PyQtForSoftimage][6]Â installed in your system, other than
that everything should work fine OOTB.

Cheers!
