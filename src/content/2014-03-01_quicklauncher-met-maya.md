Title: QuickLauncher met Maya

Hey folks,

I'm coming out of the Softimage bubble and trying to port some of my open
source projects to maya.

It's funny, of all of them QuickLauncher is the simplest but one of the
most useful at the same time (I cannot live without it) , so I decided to
give it a try and there's a maya version in the [repo](https://github.com/csaez/quicklauncher)
now :D

I'm still struggling with the maya plugin system, so the installation process
is not as straight forward as in softimage, but I'll get there.

Thanks to _David Martinez_ and _David Moulder_ for their support.

Cheers!
