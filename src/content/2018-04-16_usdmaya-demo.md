I found this demo showcasing some of the early work we did at Animal Logic regarding our
integration of USD within Autodesk Maya (aka AL_USDMaya, more
[here](https://github.com/AnimalLogic/AL_USDMaya)).

It was a fantastic experience to be involved on the many iterations integrating USD in the studio,
developing an integration of the likes of `AL_USDMaya` was a huge undertaking made only
possible by the many talented developers contribuiting within the studio and in the open source
community.

> Funnily enough this demo was never meant to be public, I was originatelly asked to recorded it as
> an informal little demo to be shared with engineers at Autodesk working on Maya's efforts to
> support USD nativelly (more [here](https://area.autodesk.com/blogs/the-maya-blog/maya-usd/)),
> It's inspiring to see all the progress made since then :)

Cheers!
