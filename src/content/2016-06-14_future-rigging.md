Hi folks,

It has been a while since the last entry, thinking about a interesting enough
topic to share and start a discussion, I remembered a few chats I've had with
some colleagues lately about the future of rigging and tought why not share here!


### A revolution is coming... eventually

If you know me or had ever chat with me about this stuff, you will know that I
have been thinking about this for a long time, there's even an old
entry about [a rigger's journey](http://www.cesarsaez.me/2013/11/rigger-journey.html)
touching a bit on this subject.

Actually, if you take a second to read my [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/cesarsaez)
profile, you will se that one of the first paragraphs goes like this (this text
has been like this since I created the profile many years ago).

>I look forward to further develop my career as technical artist, I firmly
>believe that there is much room for improvement on our workflow __and the
>current paradigm in my area of specialization__, I want to be part
>of the change. 

And it's not about big words, I _really_ mean it! I'm certain that a
revolution is coming, it has to happen, but I wasnt sure what the big changes
will look like... until now :)


### What's going on in rigging?

So rigging tech hasn't changed much in the last 10 years or so, we
have more complex assets to work with, less time, but the tech itself hasnt
changed A LOT (other than OSD and some proprietary/patented tech). If
anything it is more accessible thanks to the internet and some online academies
specializing on the subject (not as many as animation or modeling, but you
know, there's a few).

So where's the revolution?

Well, ir order to look at the futurte we need to take the past into account...
10 years ago, if you were able to rig an ik/fk limb you were set for success,
todays standards, _and expectations_, are way higher than that.

Right now, riggers are a mix of things, you have to be a bit technical to at
least automate things in order to deliver rigs on a reasonable time frame (the
complexity of highend rigs demands automation, it's not optional anymore) and
artistic enough to hack your way around and get belieable and appealing
deformations.

Said that, riggers don't need to be engineers or sculpters, it's a weird middle
ground, _and that's exactly what I think is going to change very soon_.



### Learning from the past

If we look at what happened to other areas of specialization, it's clear that
after some time were artists hack they way around the tech of the time to get a
decent-looking product out of the door, there's an inflection point where
specialized developers have to come in allowing artists to be artists and
engineers to be engineers, hacking stuff around is not enough anymore.

A perfect example of this is shading, some years ago shading artists use to
program shaders in interpreted languages and somehow eyeball surface effects
until get with the desired look. Nowadays the complexity and expected quality of
shading has forced to move the tech to specialized developers/engineers, we
moved from a hack a shader per lighting condition to photorealism and the only
way to get there was thanks to the split.

I firmly believe that _rigging has reached that inflection point_.


### But I love rigging, is it going to dissapear?

I've no idea, all this is pure expeculation, but I think rigging will stop being
a mix of things and will get a bit more serious in order to advance the tech
behind it... We can't move forward at the speed assets are moving by using
constraints and linear skin, or having layered rigs running at 6 fps.

If you look at rigging openings on big studios you have a clear split between
studios looking for _artists with some technical skills_ (great sensibility to
achieve appealing deformations, plus some scripting abilities to survive while
using proprietary tools) and the ones looking for _technical minded people
with some artistic sensibility_ (basically engineers able to create the tech
enabling modelers and animators to articulate the puppets in a believable way).

_The split is happening and the gap will only increase_ until we reach the
point where the artistic ainput can be done directly by modelers/animators
(there will be an intermediate time where riggers basically assemble rigs from
libraries and deal with the tech annoyances, wait... that's now! :) )


### Where to go from here? how to survive?

If you are all about deformations and appealing, I highly recommend to move
towards modeling (specifically sculpting), that's really the area where those
skills shine (and will keep shining for a while)... Also being familiar with
rigging requirements in terms of topology is a big plus!

On the other hand, if you are into technology, I think rigging will become way
more close to software dev and knowing 4 things about for loops and variables
will not be enough anymore, after all coding is the new literacy and knowing
the alphabet will be considered the baseline for most areas sooner than
later.

In order to really make this happen, we will need to step up big time and
become a developer/engineer (I'm not talking about the degree, but the
mindset), have a clear understanding of the main programming paradigms (opp,
functional), being able to design reasonable apis, understand data, being able 
to develop fast code by understanding the hardware (especially GPUs, parallel
computing is already a big deal when it comes to deformations).

In short, not cut corners and do the work towards those topics (not dogmas, the
real stuff), learn all the lessons we can from software development in order to
not make the same mistakes.

---

There you go, that's my armageddon right there... Of course it will not be
black or white, there's a lot of room for all kind of skills on studios of all
sizes, but if you really want to have an impact I think the changes are right
there around the corner and now is the best time to start shaping your career
towards what really moves you.

What do you think? Am I crazy? Please let me know in the comments below :)


Cheers!
