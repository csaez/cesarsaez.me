Hi folks!

Last year was all about open source for me, I finally removed my Windows
partition and went full Linux (btw, gotta love [arch linux][arch]), also
decided to develop and share my projects under open source licenses (check out
my [github profile][gh]) and have been contributing to open source projects in
hopes of giving back to the community. This post is about the latter.

I just wanted to share that there's a new release of [Amaranth][a]: a
productivity addon for [Blender][bl] by [Pablo Vazquez][pb] (a.k.a. venomgfx).

I had always wanted to dive a bit deeper into [Blender][bl] and this project
seemed the perfect excuse to do it, so I gave it a try and decided to
[contribute][pr] by doing a much needed refactoring of the code base.

That's it... if you're interested in [Blender][bl] please visit [Amaranth][a]'s
website and give it a chance. I honestly think it's worth it :)

Cheers!
