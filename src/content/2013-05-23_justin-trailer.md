Hi folks,

There's a new trailer for Justin and the Knights of Valor, a Kandor
Graphics film where I had the pleasure of working as Rigging
Supervisor.

Working on this project was an AMAZING experience, I was able to jump
into the project from the beginning and participate in the design of
almost everything rigging related, help shaping the character pipeline
and work with some of the most talented/clever guys I've ever met (well
done guys, you rock!).

I can't wait to see it in theaters... and don't forget to watch the
trailer in HD ;)

Cheers!
