Hi folks,

Some time ago [Cristobal][1] told me about his idea of a website
showcasing the best work created with Softimage, I liked it and we
started working on it until last week when we launched [softimage.tv][2]

There're a lot of amazing works done with Softimage but they are
scattered all over the place, we want to fix this through a
community-driven website showcasing the best works out there and making
things easier for newcomers (not to mention producers, agencies and
decision makers).

The community response has been HUGE (thanks guys), we have a lot of
ideas to improve the site and add new stuff, but we still need your
help.

If you ever created a tutorial for softimage, uploaded a test, done an
amazing tool, have a showreel to show off, finished a good looking job,
please help us by submitting it.

We would love to know what you guys think about it, and how we can move
things forward.

Cheers!
