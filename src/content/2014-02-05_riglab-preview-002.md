Hi guys,

Today I want to share a new preview of the rigging framework I've been
working on, it's not production ready yet but I think there's enough
features to make it interesting and somehow different from the usual
rigging tools out there.

* 00:00 - Intro
* 01:00 - Rig overview
* 03:00 - Init
* 05:22 - Multipose setup
* 09:05 - Main setup
* 10:30 - Spine setup
* 12:35 - Head setup
* 15:00 - Left leg setup
* 22:55 - Right leg (via template)
* 25:35 - Left arm setup
* 31:25 - Right arm (via template)
* 33:50 - Closing

Let me know what you think :)

Cheers!
