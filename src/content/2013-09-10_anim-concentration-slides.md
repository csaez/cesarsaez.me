Hi guys,

I'll be giving a lecture this weekend at San Luis Digital (San Luis,
Argentina). I'll talk about how we use agile software development
methodology on the rigging department during my adventures at [Kandor
Graphics][1] and some basics of pipeline in animated films.

Here is a link to the slide deck (spanish only), there're plenty of
animated gifs, memes and graphics so I don't think that language is such
a big deal on this one.

* [LIVE (heavy on images, might take a while)][2]
* [Repo][3]

So, if you're going to be in San Luis this weekend please join us at
SLD, it'll be fun :-)

Cheers!

By the way, reveal.js rocks!
