Hi folks,

Most people I interact with (in real life and social media) might already know
this, but I've moved to Sydney and have been working at [Animal
Logic](http://www.animallogic.com)  on the upcoming Batman and Ninjago LEGO
movies for the past 4 months.

Moving to Sydney has been a big change for me and I have defenitely felt
outside of my comfort zone many many times (which is a good thing). I'm having
a great time adapting to the city, meeting new people and even speaking a new
language.

Then there's AL itself, which obviously represent is a big step on my career.
Get up to speed with all the proprietary stuff has been tough but interesting
at the same time, I'm learning a lot while working in very challeging problems
and adding value to the great rigging team we have over here.

#### So... good for you, right?

Well, yeah! but I got here after a very bumpy trip and I thought that sharing
this experience could be a more interesting topic for people reading this.

People often focus on the bright side of things, attributing success to
excellence and all sort of personal greatness, which is somewhat true, but
that's not the whole story.

There's a lot to be said about perseverance, compromises, frustration, hard
decisions that have to be made in order to shape your own path... and even
worse, there's a very considerable amount of luck, of having the right contacts
and being in the right place at the right moment (which implies you have to be
in the right place at the wrong moment many many times).

For instance I got very good feedback with my latest demo reel (it was
instantly featured in [it's art
magazine](http://www.itsartmag.com/features/cesar-saez-rigging-reel)), many
recommendations in [linkedin](http://linkedin.com/in/cesarsaez) and stuff...
But between the moment I published my reel and the contract with AL were
something like 250 emails applying to job offers, 20 rejection letters (most of
the time because of the lack of an EU/USA work permit), 3 failed interviews
with big studios, an offer cancelled by a chinese studio after 3 months of
paperwork and an "almost there" by a canadian studio.

So, if you are still reading this and things are not going in the direction
you want, this is the best piece of advice I can give you:

> Keep trying, find out what's missing, fix it and try again... and again,
> and again.

There's no easy path, people tend to not share publicly the stuff going on
under the hood but it's going to be hard for you as it's for everybody else,
just keep going, keep pushing, stay hungry, stay awesome.

Cheers!
