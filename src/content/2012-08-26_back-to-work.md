Title: Back to work
Author: Cesar Saez
Tags: thoughts

I think I have enough sun and beach this summer and it's time to get
back to work!

Unfortunatelly I can't show anything from [kandor graphics][1] (my last 4
years of work are "production locked" until next year), so the plan is
start to work on a RnD reel since September until the end of this year.

But it isn't a bad thing at all, it's a great oportunity to develop some
ideas and tools I have in mind since long time ago, when you're in
production it's really difficult try new things and now I really wanna
take that oportunity. I have a good feeling about this :)

So I hope start posting again here and on my vimeo channel like in the
good old days.

RnD, there I go!
