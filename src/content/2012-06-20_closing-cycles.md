Title: Closing cycles

Hi folks,

Long time without any update, sorry about that :-(

As you may know i was working on [Kandor's next feature film][1]... and
yes, 'I was working' because I decided to take a break on my carrer, at
least for a few months, and try to find myself again.

In the last years I learn a lot as rigging supervisor, my role changed
from be working on technical stuff to work with people's motivations and
manage crisis on a production environment... the downside is I'm not
sure if be 'a manager' is what makes me happy. I really miss the old
days being the 'smart guy', looking for clever solutions to some rigging
related thing or whatever... I don't know, lately I wasn't having fun
with my job anymore and I felt lost.

Anyway... it's too early to make any conclusions, the only thing sure is
that the last 3-4 years at [Kandor][2] have been awesome and I'm really
thankful to everyone for that!

I'll miss you guys :-)

Plans for the future?

I don't know, right now I just wanna rest and take some time to think
about all this... maybe in the next entry.

Cheers!
