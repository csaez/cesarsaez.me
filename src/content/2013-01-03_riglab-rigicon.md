Hey folks,

This time I wanna share a preview of some rigging tools I'm working on.
They're highly inspired by Softimage null's implementation but with some
advantages that you can see in the video below (sorry for my english
:P).

The csRigIconEditor GUI was a really nice exercise, it's a simple UI but
as Softimage has no native PyQt implementation we have to handle the
sincronization with the selection by ourselves. At the end was a lot of
fun and I learned a couple of new tricks :)

I will be sharing this and all my tools with the first public version of
theÂ [rigging framework][1], so they should be available soon.

Cheers!
