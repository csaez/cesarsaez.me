Hi guys,

Just wanted to let you know that [QuickLauncher][ql] has been updated adding
support for script packages, I uploaded [my own scripts to github][s] in case
anyone needs some samples to get started.

There is also a quick demo on vimeo... I know, my english is not very
good, but I'm doing my best :)

Cheers!
