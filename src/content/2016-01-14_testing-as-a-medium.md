Title: Testing as a medium
Description: Introductory talk to software development testing

Hi folks,

Today I gave my first "brain swap" presentation at Animal Logic... and guess
what was the topic: testing, of course :)

Why testing? because I think there's a misunderstanding and lack of focus on
testing between technical artists/technical directors in our industry, and
every effort in terms of spread what testing is about helps.

Said that, it's tough to introduce an entire area of specialization in less
than an hour, the more you know the more specialized everything gets and I
didn't wanted to go there and confuse people. So I ended up focusing in
fundamental concepts instead, drawing some parallels between the classic
paradigm and the scientific method, and looking for ways to integrate testing
in the development process in a way that it presents short-terms benefits to
developers.

Unfortunately I can't share a recording of the presentation, and it's a shame
because it was quite interactive! with people bringing very interesting
questions/thoughts to the table.... but I can share the
[slides](http://cesarsaez.me/slides_testing)!

There you go, that was my first "brain swap" as a presenter... I hope this
helps to spread some testing love between TAs/TDs out there, give it a try on
your next project ;)

Cheers!
