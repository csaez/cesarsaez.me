Hi folks,

Some time ago I recorded this little video developing a simple particle system,
from scratch, as an exercise and I thought it would be cool to also share it in here.

The goal?

To share a straight forward approach? maybe to demythify the difficulty of getting
something like this running? (at a prototype/toy level), to finally make something standalone
and visual on some of my screencast? yet another "code kata"? who knows! :)

As usual, code is licensed under MIT at [github](https://github.com/csaez/psystem).


Let me know what you think.

Cheers!
