Title: Rigging lecture at UGR
Author: Cesar Saez
Tags: thoughts, lectures

Hey folks,

The last weekend I gave a [lecture on rigging at UGR (Granada
University)][1], was a nice experience even though prepare the program
and the class material was not as easy as I thought, but in the end
everything worked fine and everyone learned something new :-)

Lately I'm really busy at Kandor (crunch time) and find some time/energy
to do CG related things at my spare time is harder than ever... but I'm
trying and maybe this week I finally finish/release a little tool for
Softimage.

Nobody said this was going to be easy, right? ;-)

Regards
