Title: Rigging lecture at UGR
Author: Cesar Saez
Tags: thoughts, presentations

Hey folks,

The last weekend I gave a [lecture on rigging at UGR (Granada University)][1], it was a nice
experience although prepare the program and class material was not as easy as I thought, but in the
end everything went fine and everyone learned something new :)

You can grab the slides [here](https://speakerdeck.com/csaez/intro-rigging-1-spanish) and
[here](https://speakerdeck.com/csaez/intro-rigging-2-spanish) (spanish only).

In other news, I've been really busy at Kandor lately (crunch time) and finding time/energy to do
CG related projects on my spare time is getting harder than ever... but I'm trying and maybe this
week I finally finish/release a little tool for Softimage I've been working on.

Nobody said this was going to be easy, right?

Cheers!
