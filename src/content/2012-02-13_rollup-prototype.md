Gotta love ICE!

It's so fast/easy prototype a custom deformer (or whatever)
in it, it's so powerfull... I think just because of that Softimage is one of
the best 3D softwares in the market... a true life saver.

I can't wait to start working on the rigging framework/pipeline for our
next project at Kandor Graphics, ICE Kinematics will be our rock star for sure! :)
