Title: fStretch-like deformations
Author: Cesar Saez
Tags: recommended, code, rnd, tutorials

Some time ago [someone asked in si-community.com][1] about how to
replicate some deformations seen in [a nice demo from Clovis Gay][2] (who
is also inspired by the [fStretch plugin for Maya][3]) so I decided give
it a shot.

I'm solving it in 2 steps; the first ICETree stores a tension/stress map
*before* any deformation, the second does the same *after* the deformations
and compares the results. The delta between both states is used to drive
a push operator (sort of).

There's nothing faster than ICE for this kind of prototypes, love it! :)

As a side note, I'm working on some personal projects mostly for
Softimage but I'm also giving a closer look at pyMel (not as bad as I
remembered). Still early but seems possible make them cross-platform,
imply some extra work but seems like a nice oportunity to learn a lot
about Maya, we'll see...

More updates soon, stay tunned

Cheers!
