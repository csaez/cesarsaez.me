Hi guys,

Yesterday I found some early R&D work I did for
[Justin](http://justinandtheknightsofvalour.com) before joining the team
in Spain (april 2009).

These videos are from the early days and we ended up redesigning almost
everything, but it's interesting see the progression and initial goals.

It is also interesting see how naive I was at the time, jumping right into it
without thinking too much in terms of a system (unified guide? really?)...
good old days :)

More videos [here](http://vimeo.com/album/2630777).

Hope you enjoy,
Cheers!
