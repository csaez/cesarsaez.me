Hi folks,

I just wanted to post a link to the slide deck and sample code from my talk: ["How to create a character picker for Autodesk Maya"](http://www.animum3d.com/paginas/ez-cesar-saez-general).

In the talk we explored the technology behind different kinds of character pickers, there is working code of a picker built using maya commands, a qt version and a proposal for a canvas based one (using the qt graphic scene framework).

I don't know if [Animum](http://www.animum3d.com) will publish a recording of the talk (or when they are going to do it), but here is a link to the slide deck and sample code (spanish only, sorry).

Cheers!
