Title: Time to move on
Author: Cesar Saez
Tags: thoughts

Hey folks,

Just wanted to say hello, been a long time without news here :(

Well... where to start... I came back to my hometown (Santiago, Chile) a
month ago or so, my time living in Spain was AWESOME but [the project][1]
is over and it's time to start moving again.

In the meantime, my father passed away a couple of weeks ago. I don't
wanna talk too much about it here, but it was a hard news to swallow.

Anyway... I have to move on and start doing things again!

I have a lot of unfinished personal projects waiting for a spark of
motivation and a demo reel to make in order to start a job hunting.Â 

Let me press the reset button and I'll get back to you with better news
soon.

Cheers!
