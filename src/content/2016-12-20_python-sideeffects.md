Hi folks,

I would like to plug a short video/rant I recorded recently on python's memory management,
mutable types and side effects.

I still think python have its place, this video is not about bashing python or anything like that (I
actually enjoy coding on it), but there are many instances requiring us to understand what's going
on under the hood in order to debug and workaround some flaky behaviour.

Hope you enjoy and, hopefully, learn something new.

Cheers!
