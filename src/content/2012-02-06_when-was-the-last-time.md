Title: When was the last time...

Last week we had a very interesting talk on this issue. Seems like when
you're working on a project for so long, sometimes it's easy to feel
lost and this question comes to the surface quite often...

### So, when was the last time you felt proud of your work?

At the end, we all agreed it's all about *'can't see the forest for the
trees'.*

You have to get out of the forest to see it, because while you are in
the forest, you only see the trees that comprise it; but you can't see
the forest as a whole.

Yes, I know what are you thinking... really basic, right?

And I agree with you, but sometimes is good to know we're not alone and
if we continue doing our best, tomorrow we'll be proud of today's work
:-)

Cheers!
