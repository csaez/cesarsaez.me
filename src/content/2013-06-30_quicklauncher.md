Title: QuickLauncher
Author: Cesar Saez
Tags: tools, code

Hey folks,

Today I want to share a tool I've been using for a while, it's a simple
menu to search and launch softimage commnads and scripts (you can set
the script directory on the preferences).

![QuickLauncher Demo]({filename}images/quicklauncher.gif "QuickLauncher Demo")

In order to make it fast I'm caching the commands and script paths (just
the paths, the script itself is loaded on runtime), so if you add a new
script file or connect/disconnect workgroups please make sure that the
cache is reloaded (there's a command just for that) and everything
should be fine.

The menu requires [PyQtForSoftimage][1] and it's available [here][2].

Give it a try and let me know what you thinkÂ :-)

Cheers!
